# Logo Code Assignment: A Simple To-do List Application

In this code assignment, you are expected to develop a simple web based **TODO List Application**. The application should consist of two parts: *backend* and *frontend*. Here are the some specs of the application:


### Basic Requirements

 - The user must log in to application with a simple login page. This page does not need any complex login validation. You can simply check entered credentials against a constant  username/password pair.
 - Once logged in, the user can see his/her To-Do's on a simple list which he/she can perform basic CRUD operations including creating a new item, updating an existing item and deleting an existing item.

### Backend

- Backend must be developed using ASP.NET Core Web API and REST standards (You must use cross-platform .NET Core, not .NET Framework).
- You can store application's data using a simple file (json, xml, etc.) or in-memory database.
- You are not expected to follow a specific guideline for development of your backend code. However, writing clean code and using comment lines  will make it easier for us to understand your code. 

### Frontend

- You are not expected to develop a complex and fully functional page. A simple and understandable page containing basic CRUD operations is sufficient.
- You must show helpful information and error messages for every operation (e.g. "To-do created successfully", "Do you want to delete item", ...)
- There is no technology restriction for the frontend. But, it would be nice to use client side frameworks such as Angular, React, Vuejs, etc..

*Please add a Readme file to your code. This file must include information about building and running your code.*
*You can send your application to mail@logo.com.tr as a zip file which contains your backend and frontend code with all dependencies.*
